Here are a few things I've written that I have found useful over the years.
They are all written exclusively by myself but one or two do contain some
code originally written by others - see the easter calculation which
is a C rewrite of PL/1 code from Multics, for example. These seemed old
enough or trivial enough to not cause any worries, but in the unlikely event
you see something you think belongs to you, let me know and I'll be
happy to take it down.
