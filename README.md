Here are a few things I've written that I have found useful over the years.
They are mostly written by myself but some make use of code
originally written by others. These seemed old enough or trivial
enough to not cause any worries, but in the unlikely event you see
something you think belongs to you let me know and I'll be
happy to take it down.

ken.c is the program described in Ken Thompson's Turing speech.
wump.c is also Ken's, I took it from Unix v7 and made minimal changes to get it running on Linux.
mangle uses des.c which is Phil Karn's, and crc.c which came to me by unknown means - 
easter.c contains PL/1 code and beautifully detailed notes by Dennis Capps.
timecvt.c is taken from "Advanced Unix Programming" M.J.Rochkind 1985.
you can safely blame me for the rest.
