Here are a few things I've written that I have found useful over the years.
They are mostly written by myslef but one or two contain some
code originally written by others - see the easter calculation which
is a C rewrite of PL/1 code from Multics, for example. I tried to make these
uses of code written by others easy to spot. These seemed old
enough or trivial enough to not cause any worries, but in the unlikely event
you see something you think belongs to you, let me know and I'll be
happy to take it down.
